# Problem Statement (copied from bug)

When using the RootCertExport.exe or RootCertExportLinux.exe compiled from the Sample Code provided in the “Client SSL Code Samples Technical Bulletin” released in August 19, 2008 (Initial Release for WinCE) , November 20, 2015 (SetGlobalDeviceValue API deprecation and Linux STB Support)  and April 9, 2018 (Added MediaFirst Support) there are some observed behaviors after renewing the Root certificate with the same Public-Private Key Pair and attempting to add this certificate to the SslTrustedRootCerts and SslTrustedRootCertsV2 Global Value.
 
1.	The Sample Code will load the SslTrustedRootCerts and SslTrustedRootCertsV2 Global Values and Merges the values with the selected Certificate to Export to the SST file.
a.	The Merging does not remove any expired certificates.
2.	When Exporting the SST using the RootCertExport.exe for WinCE, the same SST cannot be used by the RootCertExportLinux.exe 
 
When using the Mediaroom Client 3.4 for Linux STBs, if there is an expired certificate and a valid certificate using the same Subject Key Identifier (SKID), the Mediaroom Client 3.4 will not be able validate a certificate chain for any Web Server Certificate issues from that SKID. 


# ROOT CA setup to repro bug6883021
In order to repro [bug6883021](tfsmr.mr.ericsson.se:8080/tfs/IEB/ISS%20Media%20Platform/_workitems/edit/6883021), the following three kinds certificates should be issued:
1. Expired root cert to setup a self-signed CA, when enroll this cert, set the -days = 1 to make it expired soon.
2. Renewed root cert, use same private key as setp1, we setup -days = 365 to get a long-term valid CA.
3. SSL cert issued by above CA, issued to an ASR server, i.e. BJ34-ASR-04.RNEA.IPTV.MR.ERICSSON.SE

# Detailed Steps for cert generation

1. make root CA cert.

    ``openssl req -new -x509 -keyout root.key -out root.pem -days 1 -nodes -config openssl.cnf``
    
    + ``root.key`` - private key
    
    + ``root.pem`` - certificate file in pem formate

    + ``-days 1`` - make it expired soon.

    + ``-nodes`` - stands for no des, means never ask passcode.

    + ``-config openssl.cnf`` - path to openssl config file.

    ``openssl x509 -outform der -in root.pem -out root.crt`` - convert pem to crt format.

2. Renew ROOT CA cert by same private key.    

    ``echo -e "[ v3_ca ]\nbasicConstraints= CA:TRUE\nsubjectKeyIdentifier= hash\nauthorityKeyIdentifier= keyid:always,issuer:always\n" > renewedselfsignedca.conf`` - create config file for x505 v3 extention.

    ``openssl x509 -x509toreq -in root.crt -signkey root.key -out renewroot.csr`` - get a csr file to renew root CA cert
    
    ``openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in renewroot.csr -signkey root.key -out renewedroot.crt -extfile ./renewedselfsignedca.conf -extensions v3_ca`` - Get a renewed root cert in crt format. ./renewedselfsignedca.conf ensure use same SKID to renew.

    ``openssl x509 -in renewedroot.crt -out renewedroot.pem`` - convert renewed root cert to pem format.


    ``openssl x509 -in root.pem -text -noout`` - verify the SKID and valid period of orginal root cert.

    ``openssl x509 -in renewedroot.pem -text -noout`` - verify the SKID and valid period of renewed root cert.

    ``openssl x509 -purpose -in renewedroot.pem`` - check the cert purpose, make sure Any Purpose CA : Yes

    ![](./6883021/images/purpose.png)

3. Signing a Certificate for web-server.

    ``openssl genrsa -out sslcert.key 2048`` - generate private key for web-server
 
    ``openssl req -new -key sslcert.key -out sslcert.csr -config openssl.cnf`` - generate csr file

    ``openssl x509 -req -in sslcert.csr -CA renewedroot.pem -CAkey root.key -set_serial 1 -out bj34-asr-04.pem`` - signing cert for BJ34-ASR-04 by renewed root CA cert.

4. Convert cert file from pem to pfx.
    ``openssl pkcs12 -in bj34-asr-04.pem -export -out BJ34-ASR-04.pfx -inkey sslcert.key``
    set the password as 'password' while converting.

# Install cert on Windows IIS.
copy three pfx file to windows server, import into cert store, then binding to IIS, then the two root certs show in user store.

# Files purpose
``openssl.cnf`` - openssl config file

``renewedselfsignedca.conf`` - x509 v3 extension config file

``root.key`` - root CA private key

``root.crt`` - root cert in crt format

``root.pem`` - root cert in pem format

``root.pfx`` - root cert in pfx format, password is 'password'

``renewroot.csr`` - csr file to renew root cert

``renewedroot.pem`` - renewed root cert in pem format

``renewedroot.crt`` - renewed root cert in crt format

``renewedroot.pfx`` - renewed root cert in pfx format, password is 'password'

``bj34-asr-04.csr`` - comman name is FQDN of BJ34-ASR-04

``bj34-asr-04.key`` - private key

``bj34-asr-04.pem`` - cert file in pem format

``bj34-asr-04.pfx`` - cert file in pfx format, password is "password"
